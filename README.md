# Face Palm
![Cover](./cover.jpg)


## Description
Face Palm is an interactive installation that projects the audience's face onto his/her palms. It is intended to simulate the interaction of looking down on reflective surfaces with projection mapping on hands. It provides a meditative environment with the surreal experience of the mirroring and distortions by the palm-top geometry.

## Notes
For the installation, the Processing sketch should work along with MapMapper.
